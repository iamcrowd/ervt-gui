      <h4><a href="http://nusmv.fbk.eu/" target="_blank">NuSMV</a></h4>
        <p> NuSMV is a reimplementation and extension of SMV,
          the first model checker based on BDDs. NuSMV has been designed to be an open architecture
          for model checking, which can be reliably used for the verification of industrial designs,
          as a core for custom verification tools, as a testbed for formal verification techniques,
          and applied to other research areas. </p>

      <h4><a href="https://es-static.fbk.eu/tools/nuxmv/index.php" target="_blank">NuXMV</a></h4>
        <p> nuXmv new symbolic <b>model checker</b> for the analysis of synchronous finite-state
           and infinite-state systems is OUT. </p>

      <h4><a href="https://www.lab301.cn/aalta/node2.html" target="_blank">Aalta</a></h4>
        <p>  Aalta(Another Algorithm for LTL To Büchi Automata) tool originally is developed as
          an LTL-to-Büchi translator. Compared with the traditional tableau-based translation,
          such as SPOT, it is implemented with a new algorithm, which introduces the concept of
          Obligation Set for LTL formulas. More recently, a novel on-the-fly LTL satisfiability
          checking algorithm is also proposed based on the Obligation Set.
          So far, Aalta integrates two functions: LTL-to-Büchi translation and LTL satisfiability checking.

      <h4><a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rpg/PLTLProvers/" target="_blank">pltl</a></h4>
        <p> This prover implements two <b>tableau-based methods</b>: tree and graph.
            The tree method builds a rooted tree with ancestor cycles and passes up information about
            unfulfilled eventualities from the bottom up. It is based upon a method outlined by
            Stefan Schwendimann. It is a "one-pass" method in that it identifies unfulfilled
            eventualities without making any further passes of the tree that is built.
            The method is suboptimal since its worst case behaviour requires double-exponential
            time wrt the size of the input formula(e). The graph method also builds a rooted tree in a
            depth first left to right manner, but allows cross branch edges from one branch to a
            previous branch as well as ancestor cycles. It checks eventualities "on the fly",
            and has worst case behaviour that is exponential wrt the size of the input formula(e). </p>
            
      <h4><a href="http://www.schuppan.de/viktor/trp++uc/" target="_blank">TRP++UC</a></h4>
        <p>TRP++UC is a satisfiability solver for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)
          that can extract fine-grained unsatisfiable cores for LTL.
          In particular, it annotates the subformulas of an unsatisfiable core with the time
          points at which they are relevant for unsatisfiability or it identifies
          groups of occurrences of a proposition that do not interact in a proof of unsatisfiability.
          TRP++UC extends TRP++ by Boris Konev and Ullrich Hustadt, which is based on <b>temporal resolution</b>. </p>
